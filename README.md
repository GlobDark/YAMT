## Install Guide

**Tip:** You need Pterodactyl already configured on a domain for the client to work.

**1.** Upload the file above onto a Pterodactyl NodeJS server Download the egg from Parkervcp's GitHub Repository

**2.** Unarchive the file and set the server to use NodeJS 17

**3.** Configure settings.json (specifically panel domain/apikey and discord auth settings for it to work)

**4.** Start the server (Ignore the 2 strange errors that might come up)

**5.** Login to your DNS manager, point the domain you want your dashboard to be hosted on to your VPS IP address. (Example: dashboard.domain.com 192.168.0.1)

**6.** Run apt install nginx && apt install certbot on the vps

**7.** Run ufw allow 80 and ufw allow 443 on the vps

**8.** Run certbot certonly -d <Your YAMT Domain> then do 1 and put your email

**9.** Run nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/YAMT.conf

**10.** Paste the configuration at the bottom of this and replace with the IP of the pterodactyl server including the port and with the domain you want your dashboard to be hosted on.

**11.** Run systemctl restart nginx and try open your domain.
